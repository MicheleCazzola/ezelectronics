# Dependency graph

![alt text](media/dependency_graph.png)

# Integration approach

Per ognuno dei quattro componenti presenti (User, Cart, Review, Product) Ã¨ stato seguito il seguente approccio:

1. DAO unit test, Controller unit test, Route unit test
2. DAO + DB integration test
3. Controller + DAO + DB integration test
4. API test, invocando direttamente le routes del server

# Tests

<in the table below list the test cases defined For each test report the object tested, the test level (API, integration, unit) and the technique used to define the test case (BB/ eq partitioning, BB/ boundary, WB/ statement coverage, etc)> <split the table if needed>
